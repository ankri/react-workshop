# Tasks

- [Introduction](https://github.com/ankri/react-workshop/blob/master/tasks/Task-0.md) - Let's start with the introduction: What is the application about and how to start the TDD tests
- [Task 1](https://github.com/ankri/react-workshop/blob/master/tasks/Task-1.md) - Make a reusable `<Trip />` component and use it to display the incoming trips
- [Task 2](https://github.com/ankri/react-workshop/blob/master/tasks/Task-2.md) - We want to be able to create a new trip. Let's write a form with `useState`
- (optional) [Task 3](https://github.com/ankri/react-workshop/blob/master/tasks/Task-3.md) - We want to set the locale once and use it everywhere. Use `Context` to do this
- [Task 4](https://github.com/ankri/react-workshop/blob/master/tasks/Task-4.md) - Let's have a look at the Router by editing `TripRouter.js`
- [Task 5](https://github.com/ankri/react-workshop/blob/master/tasks/Task-5.md) - We want to update the window title every time we change a route
- [Task 6](https://github.com/ankri/react-workshop/blob/master/tasks/Task-6.md) - There is a better way to use forms. Let's use `formik`
- (optional) [Task 7](https://github.com/ankri/react-workshop/blob/master/tasks/Task-7.md) - Currently the app uses two ways to retrieve the data from the server. Let's refactor to just use hooks
