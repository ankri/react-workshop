# Introduction

We'll build an application to track our expenses when we are on vacation. The data will be organized in _trips_. Each _trip_ has a start and end date. _Trips_ also have a title and the country we're visiting. The first view will be a list of all the _trips_. Choosing a _trip_ will show the _expenses_ we have or had during the trip. The _expenses_ will grouped by their day they were made and displayed in a list. It should be possible to add _expenses_ and create new _trips_. Each _expense_ should also have a title and a description. Furthermore each _expense_ should have a _category_ like "Food" or "Shopping" and a _payment type_ like "Cash", "Credit Card" or "Hotel Room".

At the start of the application we'll display list of all the trips, their duration and the total amount of expenses.
